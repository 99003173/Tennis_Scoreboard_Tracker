# Project Information

*   Over here we have a robust c software project developed which allows the umpire to simply input the points during real time to get the live score of the ongoing match. Along with the match score, he can also give additional details of the match and store it as files in hard drives. There are also provisions that allow the public in general (including the umpire) to view any previous stored match details.
*   An extra Files folder is present in the 3_Implementation folder where there are files which shows already completed matches along with a filelist.txt file which contains a list of all completed match files.
